Noteworthy accomplishments:

got some pretty decent result with just 80 ants in simulation 4917

difference critical ant threshold: 4924 (80 ants) vs 4925 (160 ants)

difference for noise, telegraphic and gain: 5011 - 5015

wall following ants:5077

AWESOME large sim 5105
Beautiful sim 5106, 5109, no clear exploitation, but arms are strong enough to lure ants in.
5110 has nice results, double highway
5121 is awesome!!!
